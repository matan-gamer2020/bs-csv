"TID_BRAWL_BOX_INFO_1","One Big Box gives you rewards similar to opening three Brawl Boxes. However, the Power Points are distributed among fewer Brawlers.\n\nYou get three random draws, each with these reward probabilities:\n\nPower Points + Coins : <NUM1> %\nRare Brawler : <NUM2> %\nSuper Rare Brawler : <NUM3> %\nEpic Brawler : <NUM4> %\nMythic Brawler : <NUM5> %\nLegendary Brawler : <NUM6> %\nStar Power : <NUM7> %\n\nIn addition, each draw gives you a 25 % chance to get Event Tickets, a 9 % chance to get Gems and a 3 % chance to get a Key Doubler. Note that Star Powers are only available for Brawlers that have reached Level 9. Once you have unlocked all rewards of a certain type, for example Rare Brawlers, the probability to get all other rewards increases. Luck: In order to make the Brawl Box opening experience more fair there is a luck system affecting the probability of Legendary Brawlers. With each draw that doesn't give you a new Brawler, your luck value is increased, and each time you get a new Brawler, your luck value goes down based on the rarity of the Brawler you got. When luck is high enough, you have a greater chance to get a Legendary Brawler, while a low luck value means that it's harder to get a new Legendary Brawler. Early draws are predetermined to ensure a fair start for everybody."
